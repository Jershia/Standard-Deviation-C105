# Standard-Deviation
  * *We learned to display a average on the line graph*
  * *It is used to display the deviated data*
  * *Then we learned about standard deviation. And saw the formula to calculate the standard deviation.*

  * *Xi is the each value in the dataset.X -bar is the mean of the values.N is the number of values in a dataset.*
### *Standard Deviation Steps :*
  *  *calculate the mean*
  *  *Subtract the mean from each number (x) (Xi-x̄)*
  *  *Square each of the differences,(Xi-x̄)²*
  *  *Add up all of the results from Step 3 to get the sum of squares,Σ(Xi-x̄)²*
  *  *Divide the sum of squares (found in Step 4) by the number of numbers minus one; that is, (n – 1). Σ(Xi-x̄)²/n-1*
  *  *Take the square root to get the result*
